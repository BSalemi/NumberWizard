# NumberWizard

Welcome to Number Wizard! 

This is a simple number guessing game built with C# and Unity. 

# Installation 

Create a new 2D project on Unity.

Ceate a C# script and paste code from NumberWizard.cs into the script.  

Drag the newly updated C# script into your Game Object under Hierarchy in Unity.



# Usage

Press Play.

The computer will greet you and ask you to choose a number between 1 and 1,000.

After making an initial guess, the computer will continue making guesses until it guesses your number. 

Use your Up and Down arrow keys and the Enter key to respond to each guess. 

Up means your number is higher than the guess, Down means lower, and Enter means your number was guessed.

Once your number has been correctly guessed, the game will start again. 

Enjoy!
